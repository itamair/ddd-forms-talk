# Drupal Dev Days Milan 2016
This is the Drupal 8 demonstration module used for my talk on Drupal 8 Forms,
#### Custom Forms and Configuration Forms: practical examples of Drupal 8 objected oriented APIs
on the 23th of June, at the Drupal Development Days, helded in Milan - 2016
Author: Italo Mairo (www.italomairo.com) - drupal.org: itamair

*This D8 example module, when enabled, creates a new Drupal entity/content type named "Magazine", 
whose contents will be used to experiment most advanced Form functionalities (Dependency Injection, Ajax Response, ecc)*


Use the incremental branches to analyze the DDD Form Example evolutions and incremental functionalities:

1-Personal-Info
2-Personal-Info-with-Twig_Template_output

> from now on it is needed you add some fake "magazine" type contents/nodes

3-Magazine-choice
4-Ajax
5-Address-Geocoding (*need to clear drupal cache / drush cr, after swithcing on this branch*)
